    <h1>Backtracking</h1>
      <p>Backtracking is a form of recursion.</p>
      
      <p>
        The usual scenario is that you are faced with a number of option, and
        you must choose one of these. After you make your choice you will get a
        new set of options; just what set of options you get depends on what
        choice you made. This procedure is repeated over and until you reach a
        final state. If you made a good sequence of choices, your final state is
        a goal state; If you didn't, it isn't.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Conceptually, you start at the root of a tree; the tree probably has
        some good leaves and some bad leaves, though it maybe that the leaves
        are all good or all bad. You want to get to a good leaf. At each node,
        beginning with the root, you choose one of its children to move to, and
        you keep this up until you get to a leaf.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Suppose you get to a bad leaf. You can backtrackto continue the search
        for a good leaf by revoking your most recent choice, and trying out the
        next option in that set of options. If you run out of options, revoke
        the choice that got you here, and try another choice at that node. If
        you end up at the root with no options left, there are no good leaves to
        be found.
